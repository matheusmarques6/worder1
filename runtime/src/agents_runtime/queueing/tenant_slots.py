"""The per-tenant concurrency cap — three turns at once, per merchant.

One noisy tenant must never occupy every worker while the others wait: the
cap is what keeps a burst on one store from becoming latency on all of them.
A job that finds its tenant full is postponed (`set_vt` short), never
dropped, never queued in memory.

VALID ONLY WHILE THE RUNTIME IS A SINGLE ASYNCIO PROCESS (ADR-2). The counts
live in this process's memory; a second process would have its own counts
and the real concurrency would be the sum. Going multi-process REQUIRES
migrating this to a distributed lease (Postgres `tenant_slots` or Redis)
first — that is the CLAUDE.md warning, travelling in the code it applies to.

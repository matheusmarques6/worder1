"""The merchant's knowledge — ingestion and similarity search (§2.5).

Like the rest of this layer, functions take a connection and never open or
commit one: the caller owns the transaction and the `SET LOCAL app.organization_id`
that scopes it. In the responder that transaction is short and its own — a
retrieval must never sit inside a transaction that also spans the LLM call
(ADR-6).

**There is no `where organization_id = …` in the search, and that is deliberate.**
Ownership is enforced by the policy, never by a hand-written clause (CLAUDE.md,
trust boundaries): a WHERE can be dropped in a refactor and nothing fails,
while dropping the policy fails the leak suite. The scope arrives through the
connection, and `tests/db/test_knowledge_retrieval.py` watches the policy doing
the work.

Cosine is the measure (`<=>`), matching the HNSW index built in S2 and the
embedding model D2 chose. Distance is turned into similarity at the edge so
call sites never have to remember which direction is better.

The vector is rendered as a literal and cast rather than adapted by a driver
extension: it is five lines against a new production dependency, and the burden
of proof is on whoever wants the dependency.

"""The evaluation trail's SQL — `eval_runs` and `judge_scores` (§6.1, §6.2).

Persistence is what makes R2 of the E2 plan survivable: iterating a prompt
against a real LLM is the expensive step, so every run lands on disk and S11
resumes from it instead of paying for the same scenarios twice.

Like the rest of this layer, functions take a connection and never open or
commit one — the caller owns the transaction and the `SET LOCAL app.organization_id`
scope that goes with it.

Two shape decisions, both forced by the schema and neither hidden in a commit
message:

  * **`kind = 'post_hoc'`.** The CHECK offers `pre_send | post_hoc`, and an
    eval run is neither a live gate nor a review of a sent message. Of the two
    it is `post_hoc`: what `pre_send` means is "this score decided whether a
    reply left the outbox", and no eval score ever does.

  * **`scenario_id` stays NULL.** The E2 pack lives in versioned JSON files
    (`runtime/evals/pack/`), not in `internal.scenarios`, and that table has no
    natural key a file could match on. The scenario ids survive in
    `eval_runs.summary`, which the data dictionary already defines as "por
    cenário". Linking the two needs an `external_id` column — additive, and it
    belongs to the milestone that gives merchants their own scenarios (E4),
    not to this one.

"""The cost trail's SQL — `internal.llm_calls` (§6.4).

Like the rest of this layer, the function takes a connection and never opens or
commits one: the caller owns the transaction and the `SET LOCAL app.organization_id`
scope that goes with it. That is what keeps the write a short transaction of
its own instead of something living across the LLM call that produced it.

The row is deliberately narrow. `provider` and `model` are both recorded
because D1 fixed the route (OpenRouter) and left the model as per-tenant
configuration — the trail has to say what was actually billed, not what the
platform assumes. There is no column for content, and there must never be: the
prompt and the reply live in `messages`, and the telemetry of S10 reads only
what is here.

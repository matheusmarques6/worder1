"""The channel port — the one door out of the platform.

Everything the engine knows about WhatsApp fits in this file: a claimed send
goes in, a provider message id comes out. The real adapters (Cloud API,
Evolution) implement this in E1's final stretch; the pipeline suite implements
it with a fake that records into the database.

Nothing outside `channels` may call a provider API — that is the import-linter
contract, and this protocol is why nobody needs to.

"""What a tool is, and the one way one is ever run.

A tool is where a message written by a stranger reaches the database. The model
chooses which one to call and with what arguments — after reading that message
— so a tool treats its arguments as hostile input and takes NOTHING about
authorisation from them. Scope comes from `ToolContext`, which comes from the
job, which came from the ingestion that resolved the tenant from the account.

`run_tool` is the only entry point, and it exists so three rules cannot be
forgotten by the next tool somebody writes:

  * **every execution is recorded** in `internal.tool_calls` — success and
    failure alike. "The agent tried to look it up and could not" is an answer a
    merchant is owed;
  * **a failing tool never kills the turn.** A tool failure is an answer the
    agent has to work without; letting it escape would cost the customer their
    reply over a provider being briefly down;
  * **latency comes from the injected clock**, like everywhere else.

Each tool opens its own SHORT transaction and sets `app.organization_id` inside it
(ADR-6 holds within the responder too). Nothing here opens a transaction around
the tool itself, because that would be a transaction spanning whatever network
call the tool makes.

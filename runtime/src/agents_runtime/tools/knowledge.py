"""`search_knowledge` — the merchant's own words, retrieved on demand.

The order of operations is the rule, not an implementation detail: embed first,
OUTSIDE any transaction, then open a short one to search. Embedding is a call
to a provider; a transaction held open across it is a database connection
hostage to somebody else's latency, which is exactly what ADR-6 forbids — and
the rule holds inside the responder, not only in the engine.

The query the model sends is the contact's question in the model's words, so it
is parsed strictly and nothing else in the arguments is read. Scope comes from
the context.

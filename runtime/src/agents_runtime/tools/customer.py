"""`get_customer_context` — who the agent is talking to.

Takes no arguments at all, and that is a security property rather than a
simplification: a tool that accepted a contact id would be a tool the model
could be talked into pointing somewhere else. The conversation is the one the
job is about, and the scope is the tenant the job belongs to.

The E2 answer is what exists today — name, language, opt status, since when,
how many conversations. The order-based context of RF-010 (`total_orders`,
`avg_ticket`, `first_order_at`) arrives with the order tables in E3; inventing
zeros for it now would be worse than its absence.

"""The LLM port — the shape everything that talks to a model speaks.

`arquitetura §3` gives `agent_core` the LLM, so the port lives here and not in a
module of its own. What arrives at a call site is always this Protocol, never an
adapter: the eval harness (S3) drives a scripted stand-in through it, the
responder (S9) drives the real one, and neither knows the difference.

D1 (decisão 79) is written into the types:

  * `model` is a STRING carried by the request, because it is per-tenant
    configuration (`agent_versions.model`). An adapter that chose the model
    would make that column decoration;
  * chat and embedding leave through the SAME door. A second provider for
    embeddings would mean a second key, a second failure mode and a second host
    in the network lock;
  * `Usage` holds what the provider says it billed. Cost is never computed here
    — a price table in the code rots silently and the trail starts lying.

`think` comes from the think-gate (S4), already decided before this point: the
port asks for extended reasoning, it never decides that it is warranted.

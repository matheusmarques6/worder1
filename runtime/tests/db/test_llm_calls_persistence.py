"""The cost trail — one row per completed LLM call, written by `worker_role`.

The credential matters as much as the row: writing as a superuser would hide a
missing GRANT and a missing policy, and the first thing to break in production
would be a privilege this suite never exercised (decisão 21).

What is asserted here and nowhere else: that `internal.llm_calls` (§6.4)
accepts what the meter produces, that a call can be attributed to a conversation
or to nothing at all (an embedding has no conversation), and that a worker
scoped to tenant A cannot write a row that says tenant B spent the money.

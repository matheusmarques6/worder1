"""E2 · S2 — the schema slice of the milestone, and the two decisions it freezes.

Three things are asserted here that no later step can re-decide cheaply:

· **One `active` version per tenant is the DATABASE's job** (D6, integrity note 1
  of the data dictionary). The source of truth is the partial unique index — not
  an FK cache on `tenants`, not application code. A second activation must be an
  error, not a race the hub happens to lose.

· **The agent's model is per-tenant configuration** (D1 as amended, decision 79):
  it lives in the version's own row with `claude-sonnet-5` as the default, so
  changing it is config, never a deploy. Judge 1 is NOT here — it is fixed by the
  platform, and a safety gate that a customer could reconfigure is not a gate.

· **The embedding dimension is frozen at 1536** (D2). This is the reason D2 had
  to be answered before S2 at all: expand-contract makes a later change to the
  column expensive, so the number is asserted rather than assumed.

"""The evaluation trail — a run and its scores, written by `worker_role`.

R2 of the E2 plan is the reason this level exists at all: iterating the prompt
against a real LLM (S11) is the expensive step, and it is only resumable if
every run is already on disk. So the harness persists BEFORE any model is
plugged in, and the credential that writes is the one production uses — not a
superuser that would hide a missing GRANT or a missing policy.

Two things are asserted here that no unit test can reach: that the row shapes
of §6.1/§6.2 accept what the harness produces, and that `eval_runs.status` is
about the RUN, never about approval — a run that completes with a blocked
rubric is `done`, because `failed` has to keep meaning "the harness broke".

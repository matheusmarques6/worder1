"""The leak suite for the conversation tables — E1 · PR-0.

Same shape and the same teeth as the identity suite of E0-07: two tenants,
three credentials, and **any row returned or affected fails**.

What is asserted per credential is not symmetric, and that is deliberate. The
sender has no grant on `contacts`, `conversations` or `messages`, so pointing it
at them would produce "permission denied" — which is evidence about a GRANT,
not about a policy (decisão 16 do E0-07). The sender is attacked where it does
have privilege: the outbox.

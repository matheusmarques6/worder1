"""Fixtures for the levels that talk to a real Postgres.

Deliberately NOT skippable. A security suite that quietly skips when the
database is missing is worse than no suite: the gate reports green and nobody
looks again. If Postgres is not reachable these tests fail, loudly.

Test data uses a per-run prefix (core/testes-e-cicd.md §3.3 item 15) so two
runs against the same database cannot collide, and teardown removes it.

"""Cenários 4, 7 and 10 — death and resurrection (E1 · PR 4, closes Fase 1).

Scenario 4 kills the REAL process and asserts that both crash windows
converge to the same final state: one reply, nothing lost, nothing doubled.
Scenario 7 walks a poisoned job to the DLQ and back — a waiting room, not a
cemetery. Scenario 10 is ADR-8 made executable: when the machine cannot know
whether a message left, it never resends; it correlates or it asks a human.

Every wait is a database predicate; every stop condition is the LAST
observable of its flow.

"""Cenários 1, 3 and 8 — the composition proven as an engine (E1 · PR 2b).

Scenario 1 is the whole thread at once: five messages in a burst leave the
webhook and one reply reaches the (fake) provider, with every invariant on
the way asserted by state, not by logs. Scenario 3 is redelivery answered by
validation instead of a second generation. Scenario 8 is the loop consuming
in EXACTLY the order the unit-level policy dictates — the same schedule, item
by item.
